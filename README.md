# Vehicle Accident Detection and Monitoring using Arduino UNO and ESP8266
&nbsp;

> ## Introduction

Yearly the road accident rate increases, and drivers are to blame as well as the road or weather conditions. Bad Vehicle drivers can't be helped, but the vehicle can be made smart enough to alert the ambulance about the location
We can also monitor the status of the vehicle and one can view the changes in the sensor data accordingly on the ThingSpeak Cloud in the Field section.
